# word-guessing-game

This game randomly selects a word from a predefined dictionary and provides up to three hints related to that word.
After each hint, the player enters a guess:
- Correct guess → You win!
- Wrong guess → You move on to the next hint
- All hints used → Game over, the correct word is revealed

## How the Game Works
- The program randomly selects a word.
- Hints related to that word are shown one by one.
- The player enters a guess after each hint.
- The player has only 3 attempts (one per hint).

- Objects (Door, Table, Clock)
- Food (Pizza)

- Countries (India, Japan, France, America)
